# Haxbox
Haxbox is a simple collection of provisioning scripts to populate and start a pentesting machine (currently only in virtualbox via vagrant).

# Project description
The idea for this project is to provide a basic pentesting environment for infosec beginners.
Current flavors:
- Vagrant:
    - Debian/buster
- Docker:
    - Debian/buster

# Ideas and suggestions
You can contact me directly if you would wish to have something added to the current provisioning scripts. Only one requirement: Let's keep it simple.
